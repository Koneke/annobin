find command? (both in hex and comments) (... regexes? :S)
help menu
bookmarks
single-char prompts (quit, save, findmode)
goto end beginning of comment (vim e/b)

; oh boy, it's been a while since I worked on this haha
better save/quit lmao (that's single-char prompts I guess?)
show comment length somehow (to quickly check if your comments match with a spec)
